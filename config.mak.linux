# Make certain that there is no name conflict with another libz.a file.
#
# If there are unresolved externals involving gzIsaGZippedFile, gzGetFile
#   and gzSetFile; the wrong zlib library is being linked to.  Check
#   /usr/lib or rename the Affine version of libz.a to libaffinez.a and
#   change ZLIB=-laffinez.  The Affine modified version of zlib only adds
#   some functionality and should be linkable to other programs that use
#   the libz.a library.
#
# See comments below regarding RIB_ZLIB compile flag for more options.

ZLIB=-lz
Z_PATH=${TOP}/../zlib
ZINC_PATH=-I${Z_PATH}

# Add any special locations for libraries related to OpenGL to OGL_PATH.
#  For example Sun's need OGL_PATH=-L/usr/openwin/lib and Linux may need 
#  a pointer to a directory with Mesa.  More than one -L path can be listed.
# Leaving OGL_INCPATH and OGL_LIBPATH means that the libraries are located
#  in a standard directory that the compiler finds without extra flags:
OGLXLIB=-lGL -lX11
OGL_INCPATH= 
OGL_LIBPATH= 

# Libtiff location:
TIFFLIB=-ltiff
TIFFPATH=${TOP}/../libtiff/libtiff
