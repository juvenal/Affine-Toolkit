PRMan's catrib program reads strings given in ASCII form with special 
escape sequences such as '\n' and expands them to a single binary 
character as shown below:

      % echo 'Surface "asd\nasd"'  | catrib
      ##RenderMan RIB
      version 3.03
      Surface "asd
      asd" 

The Affine Toolkit's typerib program also did this.  Refer to the
functions RibHandleASCIIEscChar() and RibReadString() in 
affine/readrib/readfunc.c.  

      % echo 'Surface "asd\nasd"' | typerib
      ##RenderMan RIB-Structure 1.0
      Surface "asd
      asd" 

This replacing of the '\' character sequences can cause a loss 
of data so I changed to prevent problems as shown in the following 
example where an escape character is exchanged for a NULL and begins 
to mark the middle of a string as its end:

      % echo 'Surface "asd\0asd"'  | catrib
      ##RenderMan RIB
      version 3.03
      Surface "asd" 

Note that typerib did this too and by setting the flag
REPLACE_ESCAPE_CHARACTERS when compiling this behavior
can be included in the Affine Libraries if desired.
