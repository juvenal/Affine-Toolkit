 * DESCRIPTION:  Utility to convert ASCII files from PC's running DOS, 
 *               Windoze, NT or OS/2 to follow end-of-line conventions
 *               of UNIX ASCII files.  Basically this gets rid of 
 *               those annoying ^M characters that appear when you try
 *               to edit a file from a PC.
 *   
 *    Note: IBM is a trademark of IBM.  UNIX is a trademark of somebody 
 *          else somewhere -- I lost track who owns it this month.
