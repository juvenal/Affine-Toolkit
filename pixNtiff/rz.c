 * DESCRIPTION:  
 *   
 *    Contains:
 *
 *          ReadZ() - Read Depth File.
 *
 *    References:
 *           When using the "zfile" driver to output a Z-file of 300x300,
 *           I noticed that the size was about right for uncompressed IEEE
 *           floating point data.  Checking 300 * 300 * 4 equals 360000 
 *           and the Z file size was 360136 it looked like the file format 
 *           could be just a header and the raw floating point data.  
 *           
 *           It appears that the header has some 32bit number, xres and 
 *           yres followed by two transformation matrices and the IEEE 
 *           floats in big-endian form.
