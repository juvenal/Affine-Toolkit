The following utilities are included in the Affine Toolkit:

bin2hex    -- Convert binary characters into ASCII printed hex numbers.
bin2oct    -- Convert binary characters into ASCII printed octal numbers.
dbl2oct    -- Convert ASCII printed floating point values into RIB encoded
              IEEE double precision form.
dec2hex    -- Convert ASCII printed decimal numbers into ASCII printed 
              hex numbers.
flt2oct    -- Convert ASCII printed floating point values into RIB encoded
              IEEE floats.
fp2tiff    -- Store ASCII printed floating point values into an IEEE TIFF
              file of a user specified size.
hex2bin    -- Convert ASCII printed hex numbers into binary characters.
hex2dec    -- Convert ASCII printed hex numbers into ASCII printed decimal
              numbers.
ibm2unix   -- Remove DOS, NT and OS/2 two byte carriage returns in favor 
              of UNIX version of '\n'.
mac2unix   -- Remove Mac carriage returns in favor of UNIX version of '\n'.
normfptiff -- Adjust the min to max range of values in an IEEE TIFF file 
              to be from 0 to 1.  
nulen      -- Creates IEEE TIFF files that give the arc length parameterization
              of a NURB surface.  User specifies u or v direction.
oct2bin    -- Convert ASCII printed octal numbers into binary characters.
pix2tiff   -- Convert Alias PIX files into TIFF.
pixinfo    -- Print size information of Alias PIX files.
ribbish    -- Filter RIB files for certain RIB calls.
ribdump    -- Dump binary or ASCII uncompressed RIBs.  Useful for seeing 
              how the encoding is done.
ribfixer   -- Touch-up and fix some problems with exported RIB files.
ribobjmod  -- Convert NuPatch statements into WaveFront OBJ format.  
              Functionality is very limited -- I only needed to write this
              utility for one RIB file a while back.
ribtree    -- Little demo program that creates toy-like trees.
showbits   -- Displays Alias PIX, TIFF and TGA files.  Showbits will try
              to figure out the file format if the user doesn't indicate which.
str2oct    -- Convert given ASCII strings into RIB encoded strings printed
              out as a series of ASCII octal numbers.
tga2tga    -- Test program to convert TGA uncompressed/compressed to 
              TGA compressed.
tga2tiff   -- Convert TGA to TIFF.
tgainfo    -- Print size information of TGA files.
tif2tif    -- Test program to convert TIFF uncompressed/compressed to 
              TIFF compressed files.
tiff2X     -- Convert a black and white TIFF into X Window's ASCII format.
tiff2fp    -- Print IEEE values in an IEEE TIFF file.
tiff2pix   -- Convert TIFF to Alias PIX.
tiff2tga   -- Convert TIFF to TGA compressed.
tiffedge   -- Composite TIFF images of constant surface shaded objects, 
              normal-variance shaded object, and depth maps into a Sobel
              filtered image that looks like the ink lines of a cartoon.
tokentbl   -- Creates a table that can be used to find tokens in a string
              or file.
typerib    -- Print RIB files as ASCII, binary, gzipped RIB files.
untab      -- Remove tabs from ASCII files.
z2tiff     -- Takes Pixar's Z format and converts the data into a TIFF image.
