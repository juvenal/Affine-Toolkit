Most utilities should just use -lributil -lm.  But if you just want to read a 
   RIB file use -lribrdr -lribhash -lm.  

libribconst.a -- Contains only the RI_ exported variables with the values
                 defined by the RI Specification.

libriberror.a -- Contains a default error message handler.

libribhash.a  -- Hash library for reading and writing RIB files.  Contains
                 the RI_ constants, since they are needed for setting up
                 the initial hash table.

libribmsg.a   -- Contains error messages listed in RI specification.

libribnop.a   -- Provides a Ri table with functions that do nothing but
                 return.  NOP is a abbreviation for No Operation.  This is
                 useful for filters that are only looking for one or two
                 types of RIB statements.

libribrdr.a   -- RIB Reader library.  RI_ constants and error messages 
                 included.

libribtable.a -- A table that lists all the Ri calls in the order given in
                 ribrdr.h.

libribwrtr.a  -- RIB writer library.  Has the RI_ constants and all the 
                 Ri calls listed in the RI Specification and the 
                 RenderMan Artist's Toolkit 3.7 additions.  Supports ASCII 
                 and binary RIB output.  Pixel filter functions are supported 
                 as well.

libributil.a  -- Contains the RIB reader and writer functions.  Basically
                 it's libribrdr.a, libribwrtr.a and libsribhash.a put 
                 together (also libz.a thrown in as of 7-15-97).

libsribhash.a -- Simple ribhash, basically libribhash.a but without the
                 RI_ constants.

libsribrdr.a  -- Simple RIB Reader, basically libribrdr.a but without the 
                 Ri table (libribtable.a) and error messages (libribmsg.a).

libsribw.a    -- Simple RIB writer.  Has the RI_ constants and all the
                 Ri calls listed by the RI specification and the RenderMan
                 Artist's Toolkit 3.6 additions.  It is called simple 
                 because it's basically just a bunch of printf()s, only ASCII 
                 RIB output is supported, and the pixel filter functions just 
                 return zero.
