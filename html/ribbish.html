<STRONG>ribbish</STRONG> [-o file] [-binary] [-RIBcall1 [-RIBcall2] ...] [filename ...]

Utility to print out a RIB file without a given set of RIB statements
listed by the user.

[-o file]                    Output file name.  If not given, stdout is
                             used.
[-binary]                    Print output in encoded format.
[-RIBcall1 [-RIBcall2] ...]  Name of RIB statement(s) to remove.
[filename ...]               If no file names are given then ribbish
                             will use standard input.

Note:  Many modelers include extra RIB calls that are not needed or
       that represent settings that were too annoying in the GUI to
       actually set and change their default values.  Such extra and
       unwanted RIB code is "ribbish" that can be removed by the
       ribbish utility.

Example:
        The following copies myold.rib to mynew.rib except for the
        TextureCoordinates and Color RIB statements:
             ribbish -o mynew.rib -TextureCoordinates -Color myold.rib
