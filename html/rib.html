<P>
The following utilities are included in the Affine Toolkit:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="./ribbish.html">ribbish</A>
-- Filter RIB files for certain RIB calls.
</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="./ribdump.html">ribdump</A>
-- Dump binary or ASCII uncompressed RIBs.  Useful for seeing 
   how the encoding is done.
</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="./ribfixer.html">ribfixer</A>
-- Touch-up and fix some problems with exported RIB files.
</LI>
<LI>
ribobjmod  -- Convert NuPatch statements into WaveFront OBJ format.  
              Functionality is very limited -- I only needed to write this
              utility for one RIB file a while back.
</LI>
<LI>
ribtree    -- Little demo program that creates toy-like trees.
</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="./snulen.html">snulen</A>
-- Creates IEEE TIFF files that gives the arc length parametrization
   of a NURB surface.  User specifies u or v direction.  I've been working
   on three version.  One is the Simple NuPatch Arc Length tool called
   snulen for short.  The others use adaptive subdivision and are much faster.
   The snulen tool is provided in case someone is interested in a simple
   algorithm -- which technically calculates a chord length and honestly is
   quite slow.
</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="./tokentbl.html">tokentbl</A>
-- Creates a table that can be used by certain functions to find tokens in a string
   or file.
</LI>
<LI>
typerib    -- Print RIB files as ASCII, binary, gzipped RIB files.
</LI>
