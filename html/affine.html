<H1><CENTER>Tools Based on the RenderMan Standard</CENTER></H1>
<P>
The Affine Toolkit is published to provide some useful tools to folks
using the RenderMan Standard.  Even those with a full-blown setup that
includes Pixar's RenderMan Artist Tools and an inexpensive Alias 
AutoStudio license should find the toolkit to be useful.  Those with a 
slightly cheaper setup such as a system running Amapi, Sketch! or other
PC/Mac based applications that export RIBs should also find the tools 
to be extremely helpful.
</P>

<H1><CENTER>Items Included in the Affine Toolkit</CENTER></H1>
<P>Several utilities and libraries are provided that work with RIB 
files and various bitmap formats.  The following sections provide 
an overview of what is included in the toolkit:</P>

<A NAME="Additions"></A>
<CENTER><H2>Updates to Toolkit as of 4-25-98</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Code was added to handle matching Frame, World and Attribute Begin/End
statements in separate RIB files.
RiReadArchive() is documented as acting like an inline function,
so statements that begin a Frame, World, or Attribute block 
could -- and with an very odd RIB structure -- have their
matching end block statements inside a RIB's subfile read by 
RiReadArchive().  Note that this matching scheme would cause
problems with tools such as catrib and typerib that normally
just read a RIB and do not expand given subfiles.
</P>
<P>
The following calls were added to handle querying the number of uniform,
varying and vertex parameters there are based on what the Reader library
has calculated:

<H1><CENTER>History Behind the Affine Toolkit</CENTER></H1>
<P>
The Affine Toolkit is based on only published materials regarding the
RenderMan Standard and the general subject of computer graphics.  I 
developed the code without reference to any proprietary code from 
Pixar -- inshort this code is mine and is the result of some 
research, e-mails and also experimentation with the Pixar and BMRT 
tools such as prman, rendrib and catrib.
</P>
<P>
Feed back on the toolkit is appreciated.  I will check e-mail at the
Affine domain name probably on a weekly basis depending on work.  If 
you have found a bug or have a suggestion, send e-mail to 
teb@affine.com.  Please do not send "junk e-mail" to this account.  
</P>
<P>
Hopefully this work will provide some answers to those developing 
code to export RIB files.  It would be great to see more modeling 
packages support the RenderMan Standard and export good valid RIB 
files.  Also hopefully, some folks will write some cool utilities 
that the rest of us can use.
</P>
<P>
I have tried to give credit to where credit is due.  You'll find that
each C file has a header that lists books, articles and e-mails that 
were referred to or provided inspiration in writing the code.  Many
books give a huge list of books and articles, the ones listed in the
C code are the actual references that were used not just an endless
list.  One or two books are out of print, but are accessible through 
inter-library loans.  You should still be able to assemble a good 
reference library based on the references listed.
</P>
<P>
Please follow the copyright rules given in the license file included
in the Affine Toolkit.

<H1><CENTER>How to Write Programs Using the Affine Toolkit</CENTER></H1>
<P>
Several libraries are included for reading, altering, and writing RIB files.  
Some of the libraries simply provide different ways of packaging the code that provides the
reading and writing functionality of the Affine Toolkit.  To know which library is right
for your tool and to see some examples using the Affine Toolkit refer to the following link:  
<A HREF="./coding.html">Developing Tools Using the Affine Toolkit</A>.
</P>
<P>
For reading and writing various image formats refer to the section 
<A HREF="./bmp.html#BitmapCode">Reading and Writing Various 2D Image Formats</A>.  
This section covers the functions that can be called for handling Alias's PIX, 
TIFF, TGA, Pixar's zfile and X Windows file formats.
