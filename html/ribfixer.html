<STRONG>ribfixer</STRONG> [-o file] [-binary] [-fixname. . .] [filename . . .]

 [-o file]                 Output file name.  If not given, stdout is
                           used.

 [-binary]                 Print RIB in encoded format. (not implemented)

 [-fixname. . .]           See below for list of fixes.

 [filename . . .]          If no file names are given then ribfixer
                           will use standard input.

  Several fixes and touch-ups are provided with ribfixer.  Please note,
  I would like to avoid having ribfixer ending up with a reputation of
  being a RIB breaker.  If you are not seeing the specific problems listed
  below, do not use this program.  And do not use it on a RIB file more
  than once.  Although some fixes could be run n times without problems,
  many fixes can not check if the fix was already made and therefore
  ruins a RIB file while applying the fix more than once.

  The following fixes are available with corresponding names for
  [-fixname. . .] and are applied in the order they are listed below:

    [-AliasToRenderman7.0]  Version 7.0.1 of Alias's AliasToRenderman
                            utility had a problem with NuPatch's min/max
                            values of periodic surfaces.  The min and max
                            were simply assigned the minimum and maximum
                            values of their associated knot vector.  The
                            valid range for choosing min/max values is
                            from the (order-1)th to nth knot values.
                            The range is altered to be valid.

                            Add Attribute "identifier" "name" [name]
                            for the comments of the form "# Face name",
                            "# Polyset name" and "# Surface name".

                            Calls to "TextureCoordinates 0 0 0 -1 1 0
                            1 -1" are removed.  "#Scene" is replaced 
                            with "##Scene".

                            GeneralPolygon is used incorrectly for faces
                            made of multiple curves forming separate faces.
                            It appears that the loops following the first
                            where expected to produce polygons not holes.
                            The result is that only one face is seen if
                            the "Set planar" Alias tool (using faces not 
                            trim curves) is used with more than one curve at 
                            a time.  Fix by using multiple GeneralPolygon 
                            statements.

                            GeneralPolygon is also given concave polygons
                            described in the first loop.  The RenderMan
                            standard requires that the first loop outline
                            the boundaries.  No fix given in ribfixer yet.
                            I need to test my code and clean it up a bit.

    [-AliasToRenderman7.5   Implements all the fixes mentioned above except
                            the min/max fix and also the missing Surface
                            and Polyset name attribute fix which were fixed 
                            in the 7.5 releases.  The name attribute for 
                            "# Face" is still missing in this Alias release.

                            Also fix the ##Creator version number.  
                            AliasToRenderman leaves it at 7.0.

    [-AliasToRenderman8.0   Implements all the fixes for 7.5, including 
                            version number which still says 7.0.

    [-AliasToRenderman8.1   Implements all the fixes for 7.5.

    [-AliasToRenderman8.2   Implements all the fixes for 7.5.
                            Note:  As of 12-14-97 I haven't updated to
                             8.2 yet, but I have tried a few 8.2 Designer
                             RIB files.  For now just check your RIB files
                             at first when using this flag.

    [-AliasZUp]             If modeling in Alias with Z as being up,
                            problems may appear with how the Z-axis is set
                            "up".  The Z values will increase in height
                            as Z coordinates go in the negative direction.
                            To fix the orientation, a new camera angle is
                            calculated, Y and Z coordinates in positional
                            data are swapped while the Z value is also
                            negated.  Rotate, Scale and Translate are also
                            altered to compensate.

                            If Y is set to being up, the RIB geometry is
                            correct, although the modeling windows label
                            the Z-axis as being negative pointing away from
                            the camera's point of view

    [-Amapi2.05]            Amapi 2.05 outputs a mirror image of a scene.
                            Also NURB cubes have normals pointing in.
                            The fix is done by negating the Z coordinate
                            adding a ReverseOrientation statement before
                            the geometry statements.

                            Note:  Don't export to RIB with anything grouped
                            together.  Amapi 2.05 turns a set of grouped
                            NURBS and polygons into one huge PointsGeneral-
                            Polygons call.

                            Also fix problem of 0x7f characters appearing
                            as the first characters in the name attribute
                            strings. (Amapi 2.05 Mac)

    [-Sketch2.0]            Sketch! 2.02 outputs RIBs that have an added
                            space in front of the user given names
                            shown in Attribute "identifier" statements.
                            Spotlight shaders are given an unknown
                            parameter called "falloff".  A Declare is
                            given for the "falloff".  For now, just
                            simply remove "falloff" from these calls.

                            Sketch! 2.02 will also include extra Make-
                            Texture statements for texture maps not even
                            used.  For now just leave them in the RIB.

    [-texpaths old new]...  Sketch! uses the pathnames from the system
                            the model was created on.  When rendering on
                            other systems the pathnames will probably not
                            work and need to be replaced.  Useful for
                            replacing Mac colon pathnames with paths using
                            Unix slashes.  End each path with a ':' or '/'
                            or '\'(Wintel, OS/2) so ribfixer knows which
                            system to use.  This option can be used more
                            than once.

                            If no slash or colon ends the string old, then
                            ribfixer will assume it is a full file pathname
                            and will replace the entire string old with the
                            string new.

                            Note:  Right now -texpaths only fixes Make...
                            statements since it's hard to even find
                            modeler that even does that.  A full fix would
                            require not only all the Make... statements,
                            but also the parameter data given to shaders.

    [-unitparam]            It is possible to change the range of a knot
                            vector's values and not change the shape of
                            the NURB geometry, just the min/max ranges.
                            If you alter the knot vectors and change the
                            u,v ranges that trim curves are written to,
                            a NURB surface can be reparametrized for any
                            min/max range.  A nice parametrization is 0
                            to 1 which allows simple shaders such as the
                            paintedplastic shader to be used.

                            Note:  For now ribfixer assumes that a NuPatch
                                   call and all its trimcurves are together
                                   in the same Attribute block and there is
                                   only one NuPatch in the Attribute block.
                                   Most modelers do it this way, so this
                                   restriction shouldn't be very limiting

   [-macromodel]  MacroMedia's MacroModel software created RIBs with some
                  RIB statements starting with a lower case letter.  The
                  Spec has the statements starting with capital letters,
                  but Pixar's programs do take RIB statements starting
                  with lower case letters, if the statement's name does
                  not have any capital letters in the middle of the name
                  listed in the spec.  (That's my latest theory anyway.)
                  BMRT follows the RenderMan specification and does not
                  like MacroModel's RIBs.
                  To fix this problem simply run Pixar's catrib or this
                  option with ribfixer, both take lower/upper case
                  in the way mentioned above, but then they create output
                  that matches the RI Spec.
