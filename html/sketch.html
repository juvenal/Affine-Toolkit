For those using Alias Sketch!, I have included here some example 
code to get the light sources used in Sketch! RIBs to match the Alias renderering
a little bit better.

Below is a standard spotlight shader as given in the 3.1 RI spec, but
with the L.L commented out, the code to support "decay" added, use of
"camera" space chnaged to "shader", and the
variable type "point" used in declaring the variable "A" changed to
"vector" (just to get rid of a shader 3.7 warning).  If you have 3.4 of
prman, it will not take "vector" and instead expects "point" to be used.

For Sketch! users wanting their lightsource intensities to be consistent
between prman and Sketch!'s renderer, you'll need to declare a "decay"
variable as a "uniform float" at the beginning of Sketch! RIB files; add
in the decay values as you set them in Sketch! with 0,1,2,3 for None,
Slow, Realistic and Fast respectively; use a beamdistribution of 0; and
change the "spotlight" shader name to whatever you choose to name the
shader below.  Use the pointlight shader I posted a few days ago to
replace the standard pointlight shader used by Sketch!.

Sketchpointlight(

        point   from       = point "shader" (0,0,0) )   /* light position */
{
        illuminate( from )
                Cl = intensity * lightcolor / pow(length(L),decay);
