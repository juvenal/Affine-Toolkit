You'll have to change the basis of the patches using the values given in
the last Basis statement in the RIB file.  By default the values are
RiBezierBasis basis matrices for u and v directions and both ustep and 
vstep set to 3.

I'll include a brief explanation here on changing a basis.  Hopefully 
it answers your questions without too much extra information.  

To convert from a UBasis by VBasis patch to a Bezier by Bezier basis 
patch, the control points CP of the UBasis by VBasis patch need to be 
altered to a new set of points newCP.

   Let CPx, CPy and CPz be 4x4 arrays of floats storing just the 
      X,Y and Z components of CP respectively.  
   Let newCPx, newCPy and newCPz be 4x4 arrays of floats storing 
      just the X,Y and Z components of newCP respectively.  
   Let Bezier equal the RiBezierBasis basis matrix.
   Let InvBezier equal the inverse of the RiBezierBasis basis matrix.

   newCPx = InvBezier * VBasis * CPx * Transpose(InvBezier*UBasis)
   
   newCPy = InvBezier * VBasis * CPy * Transpose(InvBezier*UBasis)
   
   newCPz = InvBezier * VBasis * CPz * Transpose(InvBezier*UBasis)

To derive the above equations and to also convert a bicubic to any form
of basis matrices you may desire, consider a point P on the surface of a 
patch defined by parameter values u and v; basis matrices U and V; 
and control points CP.  Let Px, Py and Pz be the X,Y and Z components 
of P respectively.  A carrot "^" indicates an exponent.

   Px = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V*CPx*Transpose(U)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])
   
   Py = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V*CPy*Transpose(U)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])
   
   Pz = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V*CPz*Transpose(U)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])
   
To change a basis of a bicubic patch from U1 by V1 to U2 by V2 note that

    Px = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V1*CP1x*Transpose(U1)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])
       = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V2*CP2x*Transpose(U2)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])

    Py = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V1*CP1y*Transpose(U1)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])
       = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V2*CP2y*Transpose(U2)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])

    Pz = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V1*CP1z*Transpose(U1)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])
       = [v^3  v^2  v  1]*V2*CP2z*Transpose(U2)*Transpose([u^3  u^2  u  1])
       
The above can be simplified to 

   V1*CP1x*Transpose(U1) = V2*CP2x*Transpose(U2)

   V1*CP1y*Transpose(U1) = V2*CP2y*Transpose(U2)

   V1*CP1z*Transpose(U1) = V2*CP2z*Transpose(U2)

The new control points CP2 have the following relation to the old control
points CP1:

   CP2x = Inv(V2)*V1 * CP1x * Transpose( Inv(U2) * U1 )

   CP2y = Inv(V2)*V1 * CP1y * Transpose( Inv(U2) * U1 )

   CP2z = Inv(V2)*V1 * CP1z * Transpose( Inv(U2) * U1 )

The first set of equations at the beginning of this note are taken from 
some code I wrote a couple years back.  So barring any typos, they 
should work.  For the rest, hopefully I didn't mix up my 1's and 2's, 
U's and V's while writing this.  

I believe there were course notes from SIGGRAPH '92 that provided some 
material on this.  Atleast I think it was 92.  When I wrote the code, I 
included a reference to a memo by Rob Cook which I think came from the 
'92 course notes.  For the section on basis matrices, Cook's memo 
stated it was based on Ed Catmull's thesis and also work from Tom Duff.  

To optimize code, you might consider precalculating conversion matrices
to interchange the standard basis matrices.  With five standard basis
matrices used by the RenderMan standard, there would be twenty-five
Inv(Basis2)*Basis1 matrices that can be precalculated and stored.  Note 
that when Basis2 equals Basis1, the precalculated value is simply the 
identity matrix -- which you probably don't need to waste space storing.  
That makes it only twenty precalculated matrices to store.  Only four
are needed if you are only going to convert to one of the basis matrices,
for example RiBezierBasis.

Hope that helps,
T. Burge
