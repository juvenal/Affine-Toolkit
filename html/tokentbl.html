<P>
Creates a table that can be used to find tokens in a string or file using 
the functions
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibReadFileForToken">RibReadFileForToken</A>() or 
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibReadStringForToken">RibReadStringForToken</A>().
The function 
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibGetUserParameters">RibGetUserParameters</A>()
also makes use of the tables produced by tokentbl.
</P>
<PRE>
DESCRIPTION:  

Quick and dirty table generator for the functions:
   RibReadFileForToken( RIB_HANDLE rib, char *table ),
   RibReadStringForToken( char *s, char *table, char **tokenend ), and
   RibGetUserParameters( char *table, int ntable,
                        RtInt n, RtToken tokens[], RtPointer parms[], 
                        RtPointer output[] ) functions.

Originally I wasn't planning on publishing this utility, but I started
using it too much in the toolkit.  Some folks might find such 
functions as RibGetUserParameters() to be useful and the table
parameter refers to the output created by this program.  

I have tried to give this code a good once over, but it still is rather
ugly.  It really is just a quick tool, so don't stress test it with
wild test cases.  And please do not find bugs with this thing, as that
would mean that I would have to figure it out again and I have long
since forgotten most of it.

USING THIS TOOL
---------------
This tool creates a table that can be used for finding tokens in a
string or file reasonably quickly.  It is not a great lexer, but it's
simplicity and ability to to have code that does error checking
as data is read prompted it's use in the toolkit.  

You first start by listing a set of tokens you want a function such
as RibReadStringForToken() to identify such as the following list in
the file fruits.asc:

                  Apples
                  Oranges
                  Peaches
                  Pears

These didn't have to be listed alphabetically, but they do have to
be listed one string per line and with strings grouped together
that have the same prefixing substring.

Inshort Pear and Peaches have to be listed together because of the
commond string "Pea" they each start with.  They could be listed
as Peaches followed by Pears or Pears followed by Peaches.

Using the command "tokentbl -s fruits.asc Fruits" the following 
table is created:
           char Fruits[] = {
               8,  8 ,'A','p','p','l','e','s','\0',  0,
               9,  9 ,'O','r','a','n','g','e','s','\0',  1,
               0,  3 ,'P', 'e', 'a',
               6,  6 ,'c','h','e','s','\0',  2,
               0,  4 ,'r','s','\0',  3,
           };

The table basically describes a tree structure.  The first number
of each line gives an offset to branch from the same node.  The
second number on each line gives the starting offset to a child 
node.    

In the above example, the first token "Apple" is given the ID 
number 0 and the other tokens follow in ascending order: 
Oranges(1), Pears(2) and Peaches(3).

Without the "-s" option the items in fruits.asc would be listed in
separate tables depending on the first letter.  Using the command 
"tokentbl fruits.asc Fruits" the following tables were created:

           char Fruits_A[] = {
               0,  7 ,'p','p','l','e','s','\0',  0,
           };
           char Fruits_O[] = {
               0,  8 ,'r','a','n','g','e','s','\0',  1,
           };
           
           char Fruits_P[] = {
               0,  2 , 'e', 'a',
               6,  6 ,'c','h','e','s','\0',  2,
               0,  4 ,'r','s','\0',  3,
           };
           char *Fruits_table[] = { Fruits_A, Fruits_O, Fruits_P };

The above output is useful for large sets of tokens.  Refer to 
affine/readrib/ribread.c and affine/readrib/ribtbl.c for an example 
of how these types of tables can be used.

WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN?
-------------------------
We'll refer to the last two tables entries from the first example:

               0,  3 ,'P', 'e', 'a',
               6,  6 ,'c','h','e','s','\0',  2,
               0,  4 ,'r','s','\0',  3,

Each line has the format of starting with two numbers followed by a 
list of characters and optional ID number if the last character 
is a NULL.  The first number is the offset from the first letter 
needed to move onto the next possible matching prefix.  The second 
number is the offset from the first character to the next possible 
continuation of the string after the rest of the characters on the
line have been matched.  

In the above example the common prefix ("Pea") to Pears and Peaches has
been separated from the two strings and placed on the first line.  The
number 0 indicates no other possible prefixes are given.  If the string
being examined does not start with 'P', 'e' and then an 'a' the number 0
indicates no match is possible.   The second number of the first line
is a three.  Since it is not zero, there are continuations of the 
string "Pea" that must be examined before a match is found.  A non-zero 
second value indicates that no ID number will be given on this line.  

The 3 gives the offset from the first character 'P' to the next line.
The next line's first number 6 indicates the number of characters to 
the next possible substring.  When the second line is reached, the 
letters 'P', 'e' and 'a' have been found to match the first three
characters of the string being examined.  Once "Pea" has been checked 
the 6 starting the second line indictes that more than one possible
substring can be matched.
