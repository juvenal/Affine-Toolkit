<P>
The Affine Toolkit includes libraries for reading and writing RIB files.  
The reading and writing functions are packaged together into a single library 
called libributil.a.  The functions are also packaged separately into the 
libraries libribhash.a, libribrdr.a and libribwrtr.a.  The libributil.a 
library is designed for tools that filter through RIB files 
making alterations to the data.  There are some optimizations that 
libributil.a uses for tools that act as RIB filters such as sharing the 
hash table between the reading and writing functions.  
</P>
<P>
If a tool only reads or only writes RIB data then it should be linked to 
libribhash.a and libribrdr.a for just reading or 
libsribhash.a (notice extra 's' in libsribhash) and libribwrtr.a
for just writing.  The library libributil.a could be used, but then half of
its compiled code would be unused.  In the subdirectory affine/sribw/ the 
code for a Simple RIB Writer (SRibW) is provided.  This code builds a 
library called libsribw.a 
that can act as a replacement for the library set libribhash.a and 
libribwrtr.a, but was really intended to be a reference on the RenderMan 
Standard and PRMan's recent extentions.
</P>
<P>
Regardless if your tool just reads RIB files, writes RIB files or both; 
you will need to deal with the RenderMan Interface functions.  This is a 
set of over 100 different function calls as of version 3.7 of Pixar's 
toolkit.  It is assumed that you atleast have the 
<EM>RenderMan Specification: Version 3.1</EM> and/or the book 
<EM>The RenderMan Companion</EM>.  Refer to the FAQ in 
<EM>comp.graphics.rendering.renderman</EM> for where to find these references.
</P>
<P>
The following sections describe the main functions needed to read and 
write RIBs.  But for those who must get up and running right now this 
instant, refer to the next section and follow these guidlines:
<UL>
<LI>
Refer to affine/ributil/typerib.c for an example of a complete program 
that reads and writes RIB files.
</LI>
<LI>
Link to affine/libributil.a (the math library may also be needed).  
This will handle reading and writing RIB files and includes all the Ri 
calls.  
</LI>
<LI>
If you have your own set of RI calls that should be called during the 
reading of a RIB file or stream, link to affine/libribhash.a and 
affine/libribrdr.a.  These libraries give you the ability to read RIBs and 
with the example code given below your Ri calls will be called as the RIB data 
is read.  The code from affine/ributil/typerib.c could also be used as a 
starting point.
</LI>
<LI>
If you want to implement only one Ri call differently or alter the data 
before it is printed, you will need to "hook out" the particular Ri 
function call you want from a table named 
<A HREF="./ritable.html#gRibRITable">gRibRITable[]</A> shown in the first 
example below or in the typerib program.  
The process of hooking out a Ri call is described below in the section 
<A HREF="#writingRIBfilters">Writing A RIB Filter</A>.
</LI>
</UL>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="RealQuickOverview"></A>
<H2>A Real Quick Overview</H2>
<P>
The following excerpt of code will read a RIB file called "my.rib" and 
immediately print it out in ASCII form:
</P>
<PRE>
      #include &lt;ributil.h&gt

      main()
      {
         RIB_HANDLE  rib; 

         rib = <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibOpen">RibOpen</A>( "my.rib", <A HREF="./ritable.html#gRibRITable">gRibRITable</A> /* Table included in libraries. */ );
         <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibRead">RibRead</A>(rib);
         <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibClose">RibClose</A>(rib);
      }
</PRE>
<P>
Linking to libributil.a (-lm may also be needed) provides all the Ri calls 
described in the <EM>RenderMan Companion</EM> and the additions given in 
versions 3.6 and 3.7 of Pixar's Toolkit.  
The RibUtil library also provides the calls Ribopen(), RibRead(), RibClose() 
and the table listing all the standard Ri calls 
<A HREF="./ritable.html#gRibRITable">gRibRITable[]</A>.  Refer to 
affine/ributil/typerib.c for source code to typerib, which is the Affine 
Toolkit's version of Pixar's catrib utility.  The typerib code has a few extra 
lines to specify the output filename as well, but it's a good place to start 
when writing a RIB utility.
</P>
<P>
It is also possible to link the above code with just the RIB Reader code
and your own client library.  To use your own client library do not link
with libributil.a and instead use the libraries libribhash.a, 
libribrdr.a and your client library.  This leads to some interesting
combinations such as linking the RIB Reader code with popular libraries
you might be licensed for such as librib.a, libribout.a or libprman.a.  
</P>
<H3>But what was the gRibRITable[] for?</H3>
<P>
The table <A HREF="./ritable.html#gRibRITable">gRibRITable[]</A>
 used in the RibOpen() call shown above is a table 
of function pointers that identify a set of RenderMan Interface (RI) functions.
When reading RIB data the Rib Reader library needs a set of RI calls to 
forward the parsed data for processing.  The libraries such as Pixar's 
librib.a, BMRT's libribout.a, or the Affine Toolkit's libsribw.a provide a 
set of RI calls that could be used if the desired action is to simply print 
the parsed data.  Other libraries with different purposes could be 
that
calfunctions having the standard
RenderMan Interface names.  Inshort all the functions start with the 
prefix "Ri".  But
as a programmer you may wish to subclass Ri functions.  You may also wish 
to use your own 
set of Ri calls.  Maybe even switch the whole set dynamically.  To allow 
multiple sets of 
Ri-like calls to all be linked together into the same
program, coresponding functions from each set of Ri-like calls would need 
different names
which can be simply done by using different prefixes to
distinguish them during linking.  To identify a set of functions as Ri-like 
calls that
the Affine libraries can call, the functions are placed into a table.
</P>
<P>
The Affine Toolkit was designed for filtering RIBs and being used in plugins 
to import and
export RIBs.  Such tasks as filtering in a RIB file requires the 
abilty to subclass the Ri calls.  The 
<A HREF="./ritable.html#gRibRITable">gRibRITable[]</A> lists all the 
Ri calls using the standard prefix "Ri" for each call.  But for those 
needing to subclass Ri calls, they could choose to either define their 
own table or "hook out" one or more Ri calls from
the table given to Ribopen().  A program may also need more than one 
version of a Ri call such
as two versions of RiNupatch(), one for the original 3.1 version of 
RenderMan and one for 
the new version introduced in PRMan 3.6.  Using a table that contains 
pointers to all the 
needed Ri calls allows a programmer to avoid duplicate names and allows 
for subclassing and
other advanced features.  For example, the toolkit's libraries do not 
refer to a Nupatch call
by the name RiNupatch, but instead to corresponding function pointer 
given in the table to Ribopen().
</P>
<H3>Specifying an Output Filename</H3>
<P>
To specify the output filename in the above example a call to RibBegin() 
is needed after 
RibOpen().  In the
RenderMan Interface the output filename is specified with 
<b>RiBegin( (char*)filename )</b>.  The equivalent version in the toolkit, 
is <b>RibBegin( (RIB_HANDLE)rib, (char*)filename )</b> (notice the prefix 
is "Rib" not "Ri") as shown in the following code:
</P>
<PRE>
      #include &lt;ributil.h&gt

      main()
      {
         RIB_HANDLE  rib; 

         rib = RibOpen( "old.rib", gRibRITable );
         RibBegin( rib, "new.rib" );
         RibRead(rib);
         RibClose(rib);
      }
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>But what's this RibBegin() function?  Why not just RiBegin()?</H3>

In the above example you could actually get away with using the standard 
RiBegin() call, but that's because the table gRibRITable[] which lists the
standard RenderMan Interface calls is being used.  This table lists all the 
Ri-prefixed calls including RiBegin().  The function RibBegin() calls the 
corresponding Begin call registered in the table given to Ribopen().  
If the standard RiBegin function were called in the above example, the 
only difference is that the function would be called directly and the 
ability to subclass functions would be by-passed.  Also RibBegin() 
prevents multiple Begin calls going down the subclass chain, which is 
handy if your chaining together several libraries.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a program may not need to print out a RIB file and will not 
include the standard Ri calls.  So a function named RiBegin won't be 
available.  Instead such programs will have used someone else's library 
of Ri-like calls that uses a different prefix than "Ri".  For example, the
RIB No-Operation library has all its functions prefixed with "RiNop" 
(named after the assembly function Nop).  This allows the RibNop library 
to be linked alongside libribwrtr.a or Pixar's librib.a or BMRT's 
libribout.a without any name conflicts.  
</P>
<P>
Inshort when using the functions RibOpen(), RibRead() and RibClose(), 
RibBegin() should be used not the standard RiBegin().  RibBegin() 
will use the RI table given to RibOpen() and prevent
multiple calls to the many Begin functions that could be chained 
together in a subclassing scheme.
</P>
<A NAME="writingRIBfilters"></A>
<H2>Writing A RIB Filter</H2>
<P>
When working with RIBs, you will eventually find yourself wanting to alter 
a RIB file's contents by adding certain RIB calls, removing certain RIB calls,
or changing the data given to certain shaders.  Even with the best tools,
this is a typical thing done in many animation houses and leads to the many 
Tcl and Perl scripts folks have written over the years.  
But if you'd like to write a fast program to distribute to others as a 
stand alone tool, the Affine Toolkit provides a versatile way of chaining 
together libraries and creating RIB filters.  
</P>
<P>
The way you write a RIB 
filter depends on how many RenderMan Interface functions you need to 
subclass.  You could take a predefined table of RI calls such as 
gRibRITable[] and "hook out" one or two functions.  Or you could define 
your own table of RI-like calls that receive the RIB data and forward 
an altered version onto the standard RI calls for output.
</P>
<P>
The RIB Reader code handles the reading of a RIB file and the packaging of
the data into the format needed to make Ri function calls according to the
<i>RenderMan Specifcation</i>.  To connect the RIB Reader code with a set
of Ri calls that receive the packaged data, the receiving Ri calls must be
listed in a table of the form shown in 
<A HREF="./ritable.html#gRibRITable">gRibRITable[]</A>.
</P>
<H3>Commonly Used Functions</H3>
<P>
The following functions are commonly used in writing a RIB filter:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibOpen">RibOpen</A>()
 -- Prepare to read a RIB file.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibRead">RibRead</A>()
 -- Read a RIB file.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibClose">RibClose</A>()
 -- Free resources and close RIB file.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibBegin">RibBegin</A>()
 -- Allow an output filename to be given.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibOption">RibOption</A>()
 -- Set options for the output file.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibGetUserParameters">RibGetUserParameters</A>()
 -- Sort through a parameter list for certain token names.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibKeepData">RibKeepData</A>()
 -- Tell the RIB Reader not to free up data given to a Ri call.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibMalloc">RibMalloc</A>()
 -- Allocate a memory block.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibFree">RibFree</A>()
 -- Deallocate a memory block.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibFreeVectorData">RibFreeVectorData</A>()
 -- Deallocate data in the parameter list of token/param pairs.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibQueryKeepData">RibQueryKeepData</A>()
 -- Returns nonzero value if pointers given in present Ri call point
to memory areas that should not be freed.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H3>Hooking Out A Function</H3>
<P>
If you have a small set of RI calls you wish to subclass, the method to use 
is to hook out the functions in the RI Table.  This requires you to have a 
Ri-like function for each function you wish to subclass.  For example you 
could define a function called MyRiSphere() function as shown below:
</P>
<PRE>
      #define  _RIPRIV_FUNC_TYPES 
      #include &lt;ributil.h&gt


      RtVoid MyRiSphere( RtFloat radius, RtFloat zmin, RtFloat zmax, 
      		 RtFloat thetamax,
      		 RtInt n, RtToken tokens[], RtPointer parms[] )
      { 
         ((PRiSphereV)*oldRiSphere)( radius, zmin, zmax, thetamax, n, tokens, parms );
      }
</PRE>
<P>
Once hooked into a table given to Ribopen() using a technique shown below, 
the above function would simply receive all incoming Sphere statements in 
a RIB file being read and pass the data onto the original receiver of the 
data specified by the function pointer old RiSphere.
</P>
<P>
Ok, the action taken by MyRiSphere() is not very exicting, but taken with 
the example given below, you have all the wiring needed to sublcass a 
single Ri function listed in the gRibRITable[].
</P>
<PRE>
      #define  _RIPRIV_FUNC_TYPES 
      #include &lt;ributil.h&gt

      
      /* New sphere Proto-type. */
      RtVoid MyRiSphere( RtFloat radius, RtFloat zmin, RtFloat zmax, 
      		 RtFloat thetamax,
      		 RtInt n, RtToken tokens[], RtPointer parms[] );

      /* New sphere function. */
      RtVoid MyRiSphere( RtFloat radius, RtFloat zmin, RtFloat zmax, 
      		 RtFloat thetamax,
      		 RtInt n, RtToken tokens[], RtPointer parms[] )
      { 
         ((PRiSphereV)*oldRiSphere)( radius, zmin, zmax, thetamax, n, tokens, parms );
      }


      PRIB_RIPROC  oldRiSphere = NULL;

      .
      .
      .
      rib = <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibOpen">RibOpen</A>( "old.rib", gRibRITable );

      oldRiSphere = gRibRITable[kRIB_SPHERE];
      gRibRITable[kRIB_SPHERE] = MyRiSphere;

      <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibRead">RibRead</A>(rib);
      <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibClose">RibClose</A>(rib);
      .
      .
      .

</PRE>
<P>
In the above code, the definition _RIPRIV_FUNC_TYPES is a signal that 
a set of typedefs defined in affine/include/riprivf.h 
should be used.  Unless a pointer to a Ri call is refered to, the typedefs
in affine/include/riprivf.h are not needed.  The typedefs include 
PRiSphereV which is used in the 
code above for casting.  The next line loads in all the Affine Toolkit's 
basic typedefs and proto-types.  The code that assigns a value to the 
pointer oldRiSphere is where the subclassing begins.  The pointer to the 
original Sphere function is saved in oldRiSphere, and in the following 
line it is replaced with MyRiSphere.  If MyRiSphere did not need to call
the orignal Sphere function, there would be no reason to save a pointer 
to it and the pointer oldRiSphere could be deleted from the above code.
</P>



<H3>Hooking Out All the Functions</H3>

<P>
If your tool is replacing all the Ri calls, you might consider defining 
your own Ri table.  If you refer to affine/ributil/ribnop.c, you'll see an 
example where a library needed to replace all the functions with 
functions that took the incoming data and simply returned after doing 
nothing with it.  This library is actually quite useful, if you wanted 
only the NuPatch surfaces in a RIB file, your utility would just give 
RibOpen() the table gRibNopRITable[] from the RibNop library and subclass 
the NuPatch call.
</P>
<P>
To write your own table, take the code for the table gRibNopRITable[] 
and cut-and-paste.  Then of course do a global search-and-replace on the 
prefix "RiNop" used in the table.  You could also cut-and-paste 
the functions as stubs to start your own code.  Look at the different 
libraries to find code that gives you a better starting place.
</P>
<A NAME="MoreAdvancedSubclassing"></A>
<H2>More Advanced Subclassing</H2>
<P>
The above examples show how to hook into a table of Ri calls, but the 
subclassing function only forwarded on the given data.  This section 
describes the issues involved in changing the data and the format 
the data is being presented to your code.
</P>


<A NAME="MemoryAllocations"></A>
<H3>Memory Allocations</H3>

<P>
When subclassing a funtion you typically want to replace or alter data.  
You can either rework the data given to you in its original block of 
memory or you can create a new block of memory and then free the 
original memory block.  The general rule in the Affine Toolkit is 
that every pointer given in a Ri call can be freed with RibFree().  
The only exceptions are the pointers for the vector data, normally 
called tokens[] and parms[].  All the pointers given in tokens[] 
and parms[] can be freed by your subclassing functions, but not 
the pointers tokens and parms themselves.  
</P>
<P>
Note that there are three more exceptions to the rule that all pointers
given to a Ri call can be freed: 1) the string pointer "type" given to 
kRIB_ARCHIVERECORD functions, 2) the string pointer "name" given to
kRIB_DECLARE functions, and 3) the arrays of floats "ubasis" and "vbasis"
given to kRIB_BASIS functions.  The first two can not be given to RibFree()
and the third needs to be given to RibFreeBasisMatrix() if any freeing of
either basis matrix is needed.  Extra code could be added to avoid the first
two exceptions, but it seems rather wasteful to make extra string copies.
Simply copying the basis matrices would remove a special meaning assigned
the RI_ constants used for the basis matrices.  It is typical to check for 
the RI_ constants by looking for their addresses.  A copy of matrix would
defeat such checks for standard basis matrices.
</P>
<P>
By default the RIB Reader will free all blocks of memory it gives 
to Ri calls.  This behavior could be the wrong action to take if your 
code relies on the arrays of positional data and other blocks of 
memory to stay resident.  If your subclassing function does not 
want a piece of data to be freed, the following call must be 
made before the subclassing function returns:
</P>
<PRE>
      <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibKeepData">RibKeepData</A>( rib ); /* The value rib is a RIB_HANDLE returned by RibOpen(). */
</PRE>
The above call sets a flag that prevents the data from being freed, 
but it also means that your subclassing function must call RibFree() 
for all the data it doesn't plan on using.  All the pointers to 
strings and arrays given in tokens[] and parms[] must also be freed
if no longer needed.  A handy function for freeing the vector data 
is shown below:
<PRE>
      <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibFreeVectorData">RibFreeVectorData</A>( rib, n, tokens, parms );
</PRE>
<P>
The above function frees all the data given by pointers in the arrays 
<i>tokens[]</i> and <i>parms[]</i>.  The value <i>n</i> indicates the 
length of both arrays.  
</P>
<P>
Note:  For those who hate the fact that C and C++ programs spend
many CPU cycles in malloc(), some tests were run where a caching 
scheme was used for all the RIB data and only one malloc() call 
was made at the very beginning at Ribopen().  Only with a very 
convoluted test case that hit the Ri calls 100,000 times was 
a difference of 1 second out of 28 seconds shaved off the parsing 
time.  Since the code to support this scheme looked horrible, 
I gave up on it and tar-ed the code.  The performance gain didn't 
seem worth it.
</P>
<P>
Refer to <A HREF="./memory.html">Rib Memory Functions</A> 
for more detail on the memory handling functions.
</P>



<A NAME="SortingThroughTheData"></A>
<H3>Sorting Through the Data</H3>

<P>
Many subclassing functions just need access to the parameter list for
such data as the "P" or the "Pw" arrays.  A function called 
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibGetUserParameters">RibGetUserParameters</A>()
is designed for sorting through the vector format of a parameter list
and return pointers to the arrays that are of interest.  
The function uses a table created by a utility called 
<A HREF="./tokentbl.html">tokentbl</A>,
which is included in the Affine Toolkit.  The utility takes a file 
listing each string token on a separate line such as file ppw.asc 
shown below:
</P>
<PRE>
                               P
                               Pw
</PRE>
<P>
Not much of a file, but if you want just the positional data given 
to a NuPatch, tokentbl will create a quick little parsing table 
from the above data and the command "tokentbl -s ppw.asc Ppw":
</P>
<PRE>
                              char Ppw[] = {
                                  0,  1 , 'P',
                                  2,  2 ,'\0',      0,
                                  0,  3 ,'w','\0',  1
                              };
</PRE>
<P>
An example of how to use this type of table is given below.  The 
function RibGetUserParameters() takes a pointer to an array that 
will be returned with pointers to the parameter data identified 
by the tokens in the table created by tokentbl.  An item in the 
array is NULL for no data of that name was found ("P" or "Pw" as 
an example) or it equals the pointer given in parms[].
</P>
<H3>An Example Function</H3>
<P>
The following function called MyRiNuPatchV() finds the Pw data 
in the array parms[] and outputs a simple hull for the surface: 
</P>
<PRE>
enum {
   PPWTBL_P,
   PPWTBL_PW,
   PPWTBL_LAST
};

/* 
 * The following table was created originally with the following command:
 *
 *            tokentbl -s ppw.asc Ppw
 */
char Ppw[] = {
    0,  1 , 'P',
    2,  2 ,'\0',      PPWTBL_P,
    0,  3 ,'w','\0',  PPWTBL_PW
};


RtVoid MyRiNuPatchV( RtInt nu, RtInt uorder, RtFloat uknot[], 
         RtFloat umin, RtFloat umax, 
         RtInt nv, RtInt vorder, RtFloat vknot[],
         RtFloat vmin, RtFloat vmax,
         RtInt n, RtToken tokens[], RtPointer parms[] )
{
   int  i,j;
   RtFloat  *mesh,*p,*pp, *pw;
   RtPointer  tokensfound[PPWTBL_LAST];


   <A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibGetUserParameters">RibGetUserParameters</A>( Ppw, PPWTBL_LAST, n, tokens, parms, tokensfound );
   if ( tokensfound[PPWTBL_PW] )
   {
      pw = (RtFloat*)tokensfound[PPWTBL_PW];
   }
   else
   {
      return;
   }

   p = mesh = (RtFloat*)_RibMalloc( sizeof(RtPoint)*nu*nv );
   pp = pw;
   for (i=0;i &lt nv;i++)
   {

<A NAME="AlteringDeclarations"></A>
<H2>Altering A Declaration</H2>
<P>
An RiDeclare-like function can hook the kRIB_DECLARE position of a 
Ri Table, but by the time control is given to this function 
RibDeclare() has already been called and an entry for the variable
being declared has been added to the hash table.  If you wish to
alter the declaration use 
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibFindMatch">RibFindMatch</A>()
to find the item in the hash table and alter the given HASHATOM structure.
</P>
<P>
Be aware though that altering a variable's declaration means any parameter 
list in a following statement that refers to the variable will be read based 
on the modified declaration.  Inshort, unless a RIB file is incorrect in the 
manner in which it declares variables, syntax errors may result if a 
declaration is changed from a RiDeclare-like function hooked into a Ri table.
</P>
<P>
If a RIB filter is altering how a RIB file declares its variables, the RIB 
filter should probably not link to libributil.a.  Instead libsribhash.a, 
libribrdr.a and libribwrtr.a should be linked into the program.  Linking 
the libraries separately causes two hash tables to be used.  One table is 
for handling the input RIB and the other handles the output RIB.  
</P>
<P>
In RiDeclare a parameter called name points to a string that is also pointed to
by the hash table.  When hooking into a Ri Table's chain of RiDeclare calls
do not free name.  Altering declarations is rare, so the added CPU cycles of 
creating an extra copy of name seemed wasteful.
</P>


<A NAME="AlteringHowRIBStatementsAreRead"></A>
<H2>Altering How RIB Statements Are Read</H2>
<P>
Once a RIB statement has been identified by the statement name (for example
Sphere, Torus, NuPatch, AttributeBegin, and Rotate to list a few) a
corresponding function in a table called gRibReadTable[] is called.  
The table gRibReadTable[] is a global value that lists functions that
handle reading in a RIB statement after its identifying token and calling
a corresponding function in the RIB file's Ri Table.  Functions such as
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibReadVer35Option">RibReadVer35Option</A>() 
alter the gRibReadTable[] table to change how the RIB Reader handles
RIB statements.  Once altered all subsequently opened RIB files are affected. 
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibReadVer35Option">RibReadVer35Option</A>() 
replaces the pointer gRibReadTable[kRIB_NUPATCH] with an internal function 
called RibReadVer35NuPatchV().  A function 
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibReadVer36Option">RibReadVer36Option</A>()
undoes this action.
</P>
<P>
Altering the table of reading functions gRibReadTable[] allows the RIB Reader
to handle nonstandard formated RIB statements.  The 
<A HREF="./ribcalls.html#RibReadVer35Option">RibReadVer35Option</A>() is an
example where such a feature was needed.  
</P>
<A NAME="AddingNewandNonstandardRIBStatements"></A>
<H2>Adding New and Nonstandard RIB Statements</H2>
<P>
Adding a new or nonstandard RIB statement is a little more involved than 
just altering
how a recognized RIB statement should be read.  Adding new RIB 
statements involves changes to every table that uses the kRIB_* offset values.
When PRMan 3.6 introduced RiReadArchive() and RiReadArchiveV() several files
were changed:

<UL>
<LI>
A new kRIB_* value kRIB_READARCHIVE was added to the enum list in ribrdr.h.  
</LI>
<LI>
The table gRibRITable[] in affine/readrib/ritable.c needed RiReadArchiveV() 
added.
</LI>
<LI>
The table gRibReadTable[] in affine/readrib/ribfunc.c needed 
RibReadReadArchiveV() added plus an implementation of RibReadReadArchiveV(). 
</LI>
<LI> 
The file affine/readrib/ribcalls.asc had the string "ReadArchive" added and 
the modified ribcalls.asc file was used with the tokentbl tool to produce a 
new set of tables in affine/readrib/ribtbl.c which are used by RibRead() in 
affine/readrib/readrib.c.  Refer to the description section of affine/readrib/ribtbl.c for how the tokentbl tool needs to used.  
</LI>
<LI>
A table in affine/ribhash/cparams.c also needed an additional entry.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Once the above changes were made, all the libraries such as RibNop needed
to be altered to take in account the new enumerated list of kRIB_* values
that now included a kRIB_READARCHIVE.  Depending on what you are adding
in the way of a new Ri call, this last step could have been avoided by
adding the new kRIB_ value to the very end of the enumerated list.  All
the libraries in the Affine Toolkit would simply not know about the new
call and only your code that hooks out this last index into gRibRITable[]
would be called.  To do this would also require some understanding of how
the tokentbl tool creates tables from the affine/readrib/ribcalls.asc file.
The tokentbl tool creates hardwired values instead of using kRIB_* values.
