<H1><CENTER>Ten Little Endians</CENTER></H1>
<P>
A common question that eventually comes from college students
new to the computer industry after they have misheard the
term "endian" a few times in a department meeting or hallway 
conversation is 
"What does little <i>indian</i> mean?".  
</P>
<P>
What is being said is the word "endian" used to refer to the byte order 
a processor accesses and stores its data in memory given the unit size 
of the data.  It comes from Swift's <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> (1726) 
which long before inspiring the term endian had directly added such words 
to the English language as "yahoo" referring to a brute or crude person 
and now a website.  
The word "endian" refers to the "endedness" of a piece of data 
larger than a single byte in size such as a 32-bit <i>long int</i>.  There
are two types of endedness big and little.  Depending on which of the
two a processor uses it is referred to as a big-endian or little-endian 
processor.  Alpha processors and Intel's x86 based processors use little 
endian.  Sparc, Mips and PowerPC are big endian processors. 
</P>
<P>
How Swift's <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> fits into this has to do with a war
that took place between the peoples of two cities that Gulliver encountered.  
One group cracked their eggs open on the big end and the other cracked their 
eggs open on the little end.  Hence of course, war.
</P>
<P>
The endedness of a processor is just as arbitrary.  You could argue
advantages for either way.  For programmers it really only effects those 
dealing with file formats that store binary values larger than one-byte or
those using a low level debugger that displays blocks of memory as bytes.
When a 32-bit value is stored at a given address it takes four bytes of memory.
A processor typically can address each byte of memory individually meaning 
that each byte is given a unique physical address.  Since a 32-bit value 
such as a <i>long int</i> is made up of four bytes, each byte could be 
accessed individually using four addresses.  Regardless of the endedness of a 
processor the lowest of the four byte addresses is the same address used 
to identify the 32-bit value.  Unless you need to look at 32-bit value as
a series of bytes, endedness is not an issue.  But 32-bit values have their
bytes ordered differently depending on the endedness of the processor.  A 
<i>short</i>, a 16-bit word, also has its two bytes ordered according to
the endedness.  
</P>
<P>
A 16-bit value in little endian format has its least significant byte --
the little end -- stored in the lowest address and the most significant 
byte in the byte of memory that follows.  A word in big endian format 
places the most significant byte -- the big end -- first in the lowest 
address and the least significant byte in the byte of memory that follows.  
For a 32-bit value the little endian order is the least significant byte 
in the lowest address with the next least significant in the next byte that 
follows.  Big-endian stores a 32-bit values four bytes in the reverse order 
to little endian.
</P>
<P>
If a file has four bytes that represent a 32-bit <i>int</i> in big-endian 
format the following code will store the 32-bit value in little endian format
at address <I>baseptr</i>:
<PRE>
   #ifdef LITTLE_ENDIAN
      p = baseptr;
      if ( fread( b, 1, 4, z ) < 4 )
	goto Error;
      *p++ = b[3];
      *p++ = b[2];
      *p++ = b[1];
      *p++ = b[0];
   #else
      if ( fread( p, 1, 4, z ) < 4 )
	goto Error;
      p += 4;
   #endif
</PRE>
For a processor that has 32-bit registers, code can be written to compile
correctly for little or big endian without resorting to <i>#ifdef</i>.  
The following code reads a 16-bit value that is in big-endian format and 
stores it in <i>yres</i>:
<PRE>
   if ( fread( b, 1, 2, pix ) < 2 )
     goto Error;
   yres = (b[0]<<8) | b[1];
</PRE>
If the buffer <i>b</i> contained a four byte big-endian value, <i>yres</i>
would need more shifting operators as in the following code:
<PRE>
   if ( fread( b, 1, 4, pix ) < 4 )
     goto Error;
   yres = (b[0]<<24) | (b[1]<<16) | (b[2]<<8) | b[3];
</PRE>
