I agree with Michael Johnson's answer regarding doing some
experimentation to get a feel for how the transformations work, but
reading your question it looks like you might be expecting an
Orientation RIB statement to do a few things more than it can actually
do.  

When reading about the Orientation and ReverseOrientation statements,
it's best to have both the RenderMan Spec and the RenderMan Companion. 
The specification's section "Orientation and Sides", can be a bit more
helpful than the Companion in that in does give a clearer notion that
the term "current orientation" and the term "orientation of the current
coordinate system" are regarded as separate things when handling a RIB
file.  It's easy to look at these two terms and merge them together.  If
you interpret the "current orientation" to simply be a flag that
indicates whether or not the normals need to be flipped in the opposite
direction, the Companion's reference to a detection scheme to compensate
for certain transformations starts to make more sense.

Without including the typical ASCII diagrams with slashes and
underscores attempting to draw left and right handed coordinate systems,
I'll try to use some RIB files to show how others export RIBs from their
applications and hopefully without making this note too long I'll
explain the "current orientation" term used in the spec.  I'm going to
focus on how an application can get its geometry correctly positioned
and orientated in world space.  

One should probably become familiar with three basic configurations. 
Phigs and OpenGL use a coordinate system where in a front view Y is up,
Z points into the camera and X points to the right.  RenderMan uses a
system where Y is up, Z points away from the camera and X points to the
right.  I've not seen any system have X point to the left, but I have
seen it where Z points up, Y points away and X points to the right. 
This last coordinate system is the default in Alias.  Alias does allow
you to also set Y as up, but I haven't seen any industrial designers or
animators take advantage of that feature.  I'm certain folks have, but I
bet Z up is the most used in Alias.  

You can say that RenderMan is using a left-handed coordinate system and
the others are using a right-handed system, but when converting your
data from one system to another ignore the terminology at first and
simply look at the directions the axes point and convert a single 3D
point from the original system to the target coordinate system.  If we
set Alias to use Y up, it will match the OpenGL coordinate system and
some examples of RIB output should be helpful for the questions shown
above.  With Alias using Y-up, a 3-D point placed at an absolute
location (1,2,3) is converted to RenderMan world space at location
(1,2,-3).  

You should avoid interpreting the shown negation of the Z-coordinate as
simply meaning that a "Scale 1 1 -1" can be used in your RIB output and
your geometry's positional data can be written out unchanged.  It is
better to output your geometry with the Z-coordinate negated, because
this will actually avoid flipping the normals of the surfaces.

The following is a RIB file of a bilinear NURB surface that appears as a
square in a front view.  With a perspective added, it can be seen that
the upper right corner has been pushed back one unit and the lower-left
corner pulled forward one unit.  

In the following RIB I'll show what Alias gave in the way of
transformations and geometry, but much of the other RIB statements
although good for rendering were for this example extra "ribbish", so I
edited those lines out:

---------------------------------------------------------

# When a front view has Y as up, Z pointing into the camera, and X

#    CVs and their associated u,v values:
#       -1,-1, 1, 1 -->u:0,v:0
#       -1, 1, 0, 1 -->u:0,v:1
#        1,-1, 0, 1 -->u:1,v:0

 1 -1  0 1
 1  1  1 1]
WorldEnd 
---------------------------------------------------------

In the above notice how the "Pw" data had its Z coordinates negated.  If
the "Pw" data has the Z-coordinate negation undone and a scaling
transformation used to negate the Z-coordinate instead, the geometry
appears in the same place but the normal is reversed.

The following RIB file shows the above alterations made.  The RIB file
following this one shows a technique that can be used to see if a
surface's normal is facing forward or not:
---------------------------------------------------------
#example2.rib

-1 -1  1 1
-1  1  0 1
 1 -1  0 1
 1  1 -1 1]
WorldEnd 
---------------------------------------------------------

To see that the scaling transformation did infact flip the surface's
normal add the line "Sides 1" as shown in the following RIB file and
notice that the geometry is culled.  Because the normal does not face
forward the resulting image is just blank.  In example1.rib, the
addition of a "Sides 1" statement does not cause the geometry to be
culled unlike the following RIB example.  The following is simply
example 2 with a "Sides 1" added:

---------------------------------------------------------
#example3.rib

WorldEnd 
---------------------------------------------------------

If you have geometry being culled and would like the normals to face out
or be forward facing, use ReverseOrientation.  You could also use
Orientation instead.  In the following example, I'll leave one
possibility uncommented and comment out the other two possibilities:
---------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------

Notice in example 5 how reflecting twice keeps the normal facing
forward:

Listing points clockwise makes a polygon's normal face forward and
therefore the polygon is visible even when a "Sides 1" statement is
present.  Outputting the RIB data with a negative Z coordinate did not
altered the direction of the polygon's normal.

The first, second and third points shown above were originally
(0,2,2),(0,2,-2) and (0,-1,-2) respectively.  

In the above examples, an odd number of reflections (Scale
transformations with a negative value for one of the parameters) toggled
the current coordinate system between left and right.  Each time this
occurred, the RenderMan renderer noted this as a transformation that
altered the current orientation of the coordinate system.  If an
Orientation statement were to appear requesting a particular
orientation, the render would know if the request would require the
normals of the subsequent surfaces to be reversed.  Inshort the "current
orientation" is only information about whether to alter a surface's
normal or simply leave it alone.  The "orientation of the current
coordinate system" can alter a normal, but the "current orientation" set
by the user can override this.  

So that a renderer can know how to alter normals to match what the user
wants, the determinant of the concatenated set of transformations upto
the present object space can be checked.  If a transformation has a
positive sign, it matches the sign of an ordinary non-reflecting
transformation and therefore indicates that the two have the same
orientation (left-handed).  If a negative value were encountered, that
transformation would have a different orientation from the norm and
therefore be right-handed.  There is a brief blurb about this in the
spec's section called "Orientation and Sides".  Also if you look at a
second edition Foley book at page 1105 you'll find a few bits there as
well.  I've not seen much of anything directly written about what the
RenderMan Companion called the "renderer's detection scheme", but I
believe I've included here a more technical statement describing it and
although a bit brief is hopefully accurate.

Sorry for the long note, but hopefully something here was of use.
