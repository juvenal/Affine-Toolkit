<H2>The NuPatch Arc Length Tool</H2>

<P>
Creates a TIFF file containing approximated arc lengths of a NuPatch surface.
The values are IEEE floats from 0 to 1 representing arc lengths from 0
to maximum found length.
</P>
<P>
I'll include this tool in a later release for those folks who might find it 
interesting.

<H2>Example:</H2>
<P>
The arc lengths of a NURB surface can be calculated and stored into an IEEE
TIFF image using nulen.  The following shows a simple NURB surface that 
when rendered with a texture map shows the speed both in the u and v 
direction accelerating and decelerating across the surface.  
</P>
<P>
Shown below are four TIFF images rendered from the rib file 
<A HREF="./n5x5rib.html">n5x5.rib</A>.  The first image shows the n5x5.rib 
rendered with the standard paintedplastic.sl shader.  The two following 
TIFF images were calculated with nulen and show the arclength 
parametrization going across the n5x5.rib surface.  The left image goes 
from 0 to 1 in the u direction and second image from 0 to 1 in the v direction.
</P>
<P>
Note that in the example below the sizes of the arclength texmaps were 
set to the size 256x256.  
Because of this example's geometry the left image could really be 2 pels 
high and 256 pels wide.  The right
image could be 256 pels high and 2 pels wide.  Atleast 2 rows or columns
are needed for txmake.
</P>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="nulen.jpeg" HEIGHT=974 WIDTH=612></P></CENTER>
<P>
By adding the following code to the n5x5.rib file, the two arclength 
texmaps and the shader <A HREF="./arclensl.html">tebALPaintedPlastic.sl</A>
create a uniform speed of the texture coordinates across the NURB surface:
<PRE>
       Surface "tebALPaintedPlastic" "texturename" "grid2.tex" 
	       "uarclengthmap" ["n5x5u.tex"]
	       "varclengthmap" ["n5x5v.tex"]
</PRE>
</P>
</P>
<H2>Example:</H2>
<P>
<P>
The following is a more three dimensional example.  In the top image 
the texture coordinate u travels across the surface from left to right.
Its speed slows down where there are more isoparams and then
suddenly speeds back up when there is more distance between isoparams.
In the bottom image an arclength texmap and tebALPaintedPlastic was used
to compensates for the varying speeds of u.  
</P>

<P>
When using nulen to output true arclengths and using normfptiff to
find the max and minimum the following output is printed that shows 
the maximum arc length
<PRE>

          %normfptiff -v arclengthtestU arclengthtestU.tif
          min found: 0
          max found: 10.8643
          min: 0
          max: 10.8643

</PRE>
<P>
The above value 10.8643 happens to match Alias's arc length shown in the 
following figure.
</P>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="arclen1.jpeg" HEIGHT=412 WIDTH=564></P></CENTER>
<P>
In the above example the values nulen calculated match exactly with 
Alias's calculated arc lengths.  :-)
