Tiffedge is really a little experiment I did in what would be needed to 
render a cartoon-like image using prman.  More filtering code would need 
to be added for this tool to approach production level output.  But the 
following sections may atleast be of interest to those who have wondered 
about a "cartoon" or "inker" shader and the problems involved.
</P>
<H2>An Ink Shader</H2>
<P>
At some point everybody working with the RenderMan shading
language has atleast thought of a shader that would draw ink around the
edges of an object.  The easiest technique is to give an object a constant
painted color across its surface except where the surface's normal begins 
to point away from the camera.  As the normal points away, the shader uses
a rather arbitrary angle at which to start using an ink color.
</P>
<P>
The end result using this technique can look good on simple geometry, 
especially if you are willing to spend the time adjusting numbers to 
maintain a consistent look as the geometry is moved in animation.  But as
will be seen later, there are cases where this type of shader fails to ink 
in the expected manner.  The following image is of a sphere which is the
best example for this type of shader technique.  The shader 
<A HREF="./cartoon.html">tebSimpleCartoon.sl</A> was used with  
<A HREF="./simplesphere.html">simplesphere.rib</A> to produce the following
simple example:  
</P>
</P>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="simplesphere.jpeg" HEIGHT=340 WIDTH=315></P></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Because of the sphere's geometry, the thickness of the ink lines can be 
easily adjusted.  But most geometry will have problems with radical variance 
in the ink thickness.  Other more basic problems with the technique are
seen when using flat surfaces or surfaces that from the camera's view have
edges that are formed because of hills and valleys in the surface.
The file <A HREF="./simplebox.html">simplebox.rib</A> describes an image  
of a cube with one corner pointing directly into the camera.  It is an example
of how a simple set of flat surfaces can cause problems.  
Since the cartoon shader relies on a surface curving away from the camera,
the cube does not provide any opportunities for the shader to ink the surface.
Only the reflectance model used in the shader shows any variance in the
geometry's surface.
</P>

Right angles are not the only edges not detected by using the normal to
indicate where to ink.  The following image has no ink lines added because
none of the surfaces <i>gently</i> curve away from the camera's view.  The 
white
spot is a highlight on the background that could be removed by repositioning
the light source.  The file 
<A HREF="./simplequad.html">simplequad.rib</A> was used to create the image 
below.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<H2>Detecting Edges</H2>
<P>
To get around the problems described above a simple edge detection filter
can be used to create the ink lines.  An image of the ink lines can then be 
composited over a rendering of solid painted objects.  This compositing
could be done after the solid painted image is created or during a final
rendering by placing an bilinear surface in front of the camera and using
a shader that makes the surface transparent unless an ink line is present.
</P>
<P>
To detect edges reliably requires that objects be given a reasonable solid
color that is different from surrounding objects.  The colors are only to
distinguish separate objects and do not need to be based on an objects
actual color.  The following image is of the cube example given above:
</P>
<P>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="ncube.jpeg" HEIGHT=337 WIDTH=312></P></CENTER>
</P>
<P>
To achieve the different colors is a simple matter of many Color statements
in the RIB file, but the above image was actually shaded using 
<A HREF="./normalmap.html">tebNormalMap.sl</A>.  This shader maps the normals
of a surface to different colors.  The cube example happens to lend itself
nicely to it.
</P>
<P>
Using the command "tiffedge -o ncubeedges.tif nbox.tif" the following image 
of the edges was created.  More filtering would be needed to smooth out some 
of the lines.
</P>
<P>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="ncubeedges.jpeg" HEIGHT=336 WIDTH=312></P></CENTER>
</P>
The above geometry was very simple.  So the following example is included
to show a more complex set of geometry going through the process.  The first
is the standard image of an aluminum can.  The second is from the same RIB
file just using <A HREF="./normalmap.html">tebNormalMap.sl</A> as the shader 
to show the normals.  The third image was created by tiffedge.
</P>
<P>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="al.jpeg" HEIGHT=522 WIDTH=657></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="aln.jpeg" HEIGHT=522 WIDTH=658></P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="ale.jpeg" HEIGHT=521 WIDTH=657></P></CENTER>
</P>
<P>
The above geometry was not designed for being "cartooned".  But even 
geometry that lends itself better to edge detection would need more
filtering code in tiffedge to produce smooth lines.  The above geometry
is actually a difficult model to make edge detection look good, 
but it does show how a complex surface can have its edges outlined 
whether they are internal to a surface or the joining of two surfaces.
Better edge detection can be done by manually setting different 
surfaces to different arbitrarily assigned colors.  
</P>
<P>
The tiffedge tool can also take Z-file information that was converted over
into IEEE TIFF format using z2tiff and "normfptiff -ZeroOutInf".  The 
z-file information tends not to contribute much more in the way of edge 
detection.  The images with separate colors for each geometry or colors for 
the normals appear to produce the same amount of edge detection in most cases.
