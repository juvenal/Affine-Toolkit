/* The following are options for reading arrays and strings:
 *
 * (options & kRIB_BRACKETS_MASK)==kRIB_BRACKETS_NONE
 *    The value being read is not surrounded by square brackets.  
 *    RIB statements do not allow brackets around strings except for
 *    data in a parameter list.
 *
 *    For example, the statement:
 *
 *             Surface "paintedplastic" "texturename" "grid2.tex"
 *
 *    can not have brackets around "paintedplastic" without causing a
 *    syntax error (such as catrib's P79014 RIB syntax error).
 *
 *    Tokens can not have brackets.  For example, in the statement:
 *
 *             Surface "paintedplastic" "texturename" "grid2.tex"
 *
 *    the string "texturename" is the token part of a token and 
 *    parameter pair and can not have brackets around it.
 * 
 *    The following causes a syntax error (such as catrib's P79014 
 *    RIB syntax error):
 *
 *             Surface "paintedplastic" ["texturename"] "grid2.tex"
 *
 * (options & kRIB_BRACKETS_MASK)==kRIB_BRACKETS_OPTIONAL
 *    The following calls have optional brackets around the values given
 *    them: Bound, Color, Cone, CropWindow, Cylinder, Detail, DetailRange, 
 *    Disk, Hyperboloid, Opacity, Paraboloid, ScreenWindow, Sphere, 
 *    TextureCoordinates, and Torus.  These calls can have the values given
 *    them in the form of an encoded array of IEEE floats.
 *
 *    The following are valid RIB statements (Note that the '[' character
 *    can also be adjacent to the RIB request such as "Color[1 1 1]".):
 *
 *           Color 1 1 1
 *           Color[1 1 1]
 *           CropWindow 0.0 0.0 1 1.0 
 *           CropWindow [0 0 1 1 ]
 *
 *    Skew is mentioned in the spec [PIXA89] as allowing brackets, but catrib
 *    doesn't appear to like it.  I'm tempted to write it off as a 
 *    cut-paste typo in the spec.  The suspected typo is also in HTML 3.6 
 *    version of the RenderMan Interface Specification.
 *
 * (options & kRIB_BRACKETS_MASK)==kRIB_BRACKETS_PARAML
 *    The parameter "grid2.tex" in the above example can have optional
 *    brackets.  The following statements are both valid (note the last
 *    string "grid2.tex"):
 *
 *             Surface "paintedplastic" "texturename" "grid2.tex"
 *             Surface "paintedplastic" "texturename" ["grid2.tex"]
 *
 *    The brackets are also optional for parameters that are either a single 
 *    integer or a single floating point value.  The following statements
 *    are both valid (notice the format given the last "1" on each line):
 *
 *            LightSource "distantlight" 1 "intensity" 1
 *            LightSource "distantlight" 1 "intensity" [1]
 *
 *    The parameter data in a parameter lists can have optional brackets
 *    only when the data is a single string, float or integer.  Use
 *    kRIB_BRACKETS_PARAML to get this behavior when reading an array or
 *    string.
 *
 * (options & kRIB_BRACKETS_MASK)==kRIB_BRACKETS_REQUIRED
 *    In parameter lists arrays of more than one floating point value or 
 *    integer value require brackets.  The following statement is valid 
 *    syntatically:
 *
 *        Transform [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16]
 *    
 *    Without the brackets in the above array there would be a syntax
 *    error.  An encoded array of IEEE floats acts like a bracketed array
 *    of floats.
 *
 * (options & kRIB_BRACKETS_MASK)==kRIB_BRACKETS_CLOSE
 *    Used if an open bracket was already read and a closing square
 *    bracket should be found.
 *
 * options & kRIB_STRING_ENCODED
 *    Accept only encoded strings.  This is used for reading a definition 
 *    for a RI request where strings in the normal ASCII format delimited
 *    by beginning and ending quotes are not allowed.
 *    
 *    The spec [PIXA89] says strings in ASCII form are used for defining 
 *    a RI request, but this doesn't seem to work.  Only encoded strings 
 *    or a reference to a defined string seems to work with catrib 3.6c.
 *
 * options & kRIB_STRING_RTARRAY
 *    Makes RibReadString() accumulate strings in rib->pbuf.  This allows
 *    one block of memory to be allocated for all of the strings and 
 *    an array of pointers to them..
 *
 * options & kRIB_STRING_RTSTRING
 *    RibReadString() will return a char** (pointer to a pointer to a char
 *    array) instead of a normal char*.  This is for strings placed on the
 *    parameter list.
 *
 *    When passing a string in a parameter list, a simple char* is not
 *    used.  Instead a pointer to a char* is used.  Inshort, if "texture"
 *    is declared and initialized with the following C code:
 *              char *texture = "texturename";
 *    a call using "texture" in a parameter list would require &texture
 *    to be used not just texture such as the following example:
 *              RiSurface( "Bob", "texturename", &texture, RI_NULL );
 *    The above call is correct and the following call would core dump 
 *    with the RIB writer libraries available:
 *              RiSurface( "Bob", "texturename", texture, RI_NULL );
 *  
 *    This extra dereferencing appears to be setup this way because 
 *    RtString is treated as a type and a parameter list contains 
 *    RtPointer's to RtFloat's, RtInt's and also RtString's.  For strings
 *    this turns into a pointer to a pointer to a block of characters.
 *
 *    The RIB Reader library counts on a function listed in the RI Table
 *    being able to call RibFree() for any pointers to data that it is 
 *    given.  (As a side note:  If a RI Table function wants to keep some
 *    of the data it is given, but release other pieces, then it needs to
 *    call RibKeepData().  This prevents the RIB Reader from freeing all of
 *    the data after the RI Table function returns, but it also means that
 *    the RI Table function must call RibFree() for the pieces of data it
 *    wishes to discard -- because the RIB Reader won't be freeing anything.)
 *
 *    To get around the pointer to pointer issue and allow RI Table functions
 *    to call RibFree() for all pointers including parameter list strings,
 *    the RIB Reader library allocates space for the string and space for a
 *    pointer.  These two allocated areas are really allocated with one call
 *    to malloc() and the RtString pointer is placed in the first few bytes
 *    of the memory area.  
 *
 * options & kRIB_ARRAY_ENCODED
 *    Set RibReadFloatingPointArray() to only accept an encoded array
 *    of floating point values.
 *
 * options & kRIB_ARRAY_INTEGER
 *    Set RibReadArrayAndLength() to only accept integers in the array.
 *
 * options & kRIB_ARRAY_FLOAT
 *    Set RibReadArrayAndLength() to only accept floating point values in 
 *    the array.  
 *
 * options & kRIB_ARRAY_STRING
 *    Set RibReadArrayAndLength() to only accept strings in the array.
